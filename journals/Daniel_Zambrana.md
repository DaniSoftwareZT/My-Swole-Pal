My Swole Pal - Journal
## Thursday, February 9, 2023
Today I felt like I couln't do much, power is out at the house and everything is a mess! Had to go to a library to get some bad wifi reception. Nonetheless I watched some fastapi videos shared by the team on slack and also some I looked on youtube. Excalidraw is looking pretty legit and nicely formatted which will def give us an opportunity or advantage when making the project.

Felt useless due to lack of electricity at my house. Could only talk to my team through slack and had to change some things about the project. Still doing a fitness app but had to change some things in the wireframing that were considered too complicated.
