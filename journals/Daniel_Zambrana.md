My Swole Pal - Journal
## Thursday, February 9, 2023
Today I felt like I couln't do much, power is out at the house and everything is a mess! Had to go to a library to get some bad wifi reception. Nonetheless I watched some fastapi videos shared by the team on slack and also some I looked on youtube. Excalidraw is looking pretty legit and nicely formatted which will def give us an opportunity or advantage when making the project.

Felt useless due to lack of electricity at my house. Could only talk to my team through slack and had to change some things about the project. Still doing a fitness app but had to change some things in the wireframing that were considered too complicated.

Today has been a looooooong day. Contributed to the team by making some api-desings and modifying what they have previously done which made me feel useful. Still trying to get around the fastapi stuff and everything else. The idea for the project now seems do-able and the idea has been modified from having a log and template, to making it more simple and leaving the log and template for the stretch goals.

Today the team made progress! Watching the fastapi videos and keeping up with them following every single step. Had some up and downs on where some certain code will be placed and how. A SEIR was able to help us out and shine a light on us. We tried to work on authentication but had to work on some query and fastapi stuff as well.

Today we have been watching JWTdown videos all day and just following everything the video is doing. So far the progress has been good and the questions we've had have been answered. We got stuck on some hashed_password stuff when creating an account. Luckily for us a SEIR managed to help us as well as the team.

Finishing the backend of the project was a real test. Added some files and documents to our routers and queries which will be the finishing touches to this step. Got stuck in the fastapi trying to create a workout but managed to get it solved! All of our endpoints are close to done!

## Wednesday, February 22, 2023
We finished the back-end of the project. Probably we will have to go back to make a few tweaks and changes, but for the most part all of our endpoints are done.

Learning Redux has been a struggle since it is something new for the whole team. Created a new branch to start working and doing some stuff of the frontend and some authentication.

## Friday, February 24, 2023
We setup the caprover and got it properly working so thats a plus! Also continued to work on Redux and some more front-end of the application.

## Monday, February 27, 2023
We continued to work on the front-end of the project. We got the signup to work and we attempted to add some modals for signup and login which have been a pain. Added some fixes to the main project and to the loginform.js

## Tuesday, February 28, 2023
So we abandoned the Modal idea, and we just finished the signup, login and logout on the frontend of the project and it WORKS! So we merged this branch with the main since everything seems to be good!

## Wednesday, March 1, 2023
So we got the modal working and Instructor Candace helped us A LOT!! We were stuck the past two days and now everything is good and we got the workout list working! Everything is good and now on to the next step and make it look nice!

## Thursday, March 2, 2023
Frontend looking better each day, we still need to properly style it but functionality wise its good for now. We got some workout cards working and looking good as well as the workout search in the web page. We finished the day by adding some nice designs to the list page.
