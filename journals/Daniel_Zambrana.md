Today I felt like I couln't do much, power is out at the house and everything is a mess! Had to go to a library to get some bad wifi reception. Nonetheless I watched some fastapi videos shared by the team on slack and also some I looked on youtube. Excalidraw is looking pretty legit and nicely formatted which will def give us an opportunity or advantage when making the project.

Felt useless due to lack of electricity at my house. Could only talk to my team through slack and had to change some things about the project. Still doing a fitness app but had to change some things in the wireframing that were considered too complicated.

Today has been a looooooong day. Contributed to the team by making some api-desings and modifying what they have previously done which made me feel useful. Still trying to get around the fastapi stuff and everything else. The idea for the project now seems do-able and the idea has been modified from having a log and template, to making it more simple and leaving the log and template for the stretch goals.

Today the team made progress! Watching the fastapi videos and keeping up with them following every single step. Had some up and downs on where some certain code will be placed and how. A SEIR was able to help us out and shine a light on us. We tried to work on authentication but had to work on some query and fastapi stuff as well.

Today we have been watching JWTdown videos all day and just following everything the video is doing. So far the progress has been good and the questions we've had have been answered. We got stuck on some hashed_password stuff when creating an account. Luckily for us a SEIR managed to help us as well as the team.
