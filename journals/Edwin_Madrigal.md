We decided on creating a workout planner app. We began collaborating on Excalidraw by creating a wireframe for all of the different front end pages that the users we encounter.
We created pages for the front page not signed up, to login, signup, look at exercies, create templates, update templates, and add to calendar.

After sharing our screen, we worked on creating the endpoints and details for each HTTP request. One of us was writing down the teams comments and input into the api=design.md file.
We got through what we thing are all of the endpoints we will use.

On this day Riley made us realize that we should simplify certain aspects of our project, so after redoing parts of our wireframe we had a new set up that we would be using to design our web aplication and use the harder aspect of our original design as stretch goals.

It was my turn to code today and we went through the fast api database video tutorials to set up the account table, queries, and endpoints for creating accounts. We learned a lot today about how to use fast api and incorporate pydantic and psycopg to connect to our database and make our models.

Today we went through the authentication process for creating a user account, logging in a user, logging out the user. We then started going through the endpoints for our exercises and workouts

With Daniel as the coder for today, we created our fast API routes for workouts and their respective queries. These routes were for getting a list of all workouts for the logged in user, creating a workout for the user, and udpating a workout for a user.

Jessica was the coder and we used our experience making the workout routes to incorporate our third party API into our application. We can now successfully use the API to get a list of exercises depending on what the user adds as the filter parameters. We made it using a post request to our backend, but we may need to change it to a get and use queries to have it follow more traditional CRUD templates.

Ally was the coder for today and we completed all of our routes for accounts, workouts, and exercies, as well as using the third party API. We can do all necessary CRUD methods for each aspect of our database.

I was our coder for today. We began working on the front end by creating the layout for the landing page, and a sign up form. We created the sign up form in React, and then we worked on updating it to work with Redux toolkit. We did get the front end to sucessfully create a user, and now we will work on having the user sign in using their authentication token and ensuring that all necessary endpoints are protected.

## February 27 2023

With Daniel as our coder for the day we completed the sign up page for the front end with authentication. Afterwards we worked on completing the login/signup modal. We did not complete the modal before the day ended.

## February 28 2023

Jessica was our coder for the day and we were able to complete all of the frontned authentication for logging in, logging out, and signing up. After we finished the user porion we started to work on incorporating the exercise API we found for our exercise search page.

## March 1 2023

I was the coder for today. We were able to complete the exercise search functionality with the user choosing which filters to use for an exercise. This form is then sent out to the API and we show the results on our page with each exercise being in its own card

## March 2 2023

Ally was the coder for today and we worked on creating a workout page for the user. We were able to have the exercises associated with an account appear for a specific workout. We also implemented a delete button for the workouts where the user can delete an exercise from a workout.
