We were back and forth between picking the old fashioned react and redux for the signin page. We finally got it to work with redux. Jessica was the driver for today.

## February 27, 2023
We picked up where we left off last Friday and continued working on redux and react -- which was confusing to us. We got our front end sign up page working with authentication. We also tried a login/sign up modal but it did not work. Daniel is the driver for today.

I was the coder for today. Did some set up for the caprover deployment which was working. Then we were stuck on a weird bug which required us to delete-reinstall the nodes modules. Continued working on redux. Happy Friday!

We started on the frontend today. Created a working sign in and some basic redux files. Edwin was the coder.

we finished our backend. We finished get, post, update, and delete workouts. In addition, we created search for an exercise based on various parameters and add them to workout. We can also delete an exercise from a workout.

I am the driver today -- we got a lot of work done, basically all of the backend authentification. Finished the authenticator.py and created the remaining routes for the accounts. Went over how data flows with Louise, which was very informative and helpful

Started on the account service. With Edwin typing, we as a group started working on the account part of our project. We watched the relevant fastAPI videos from curtis and finished the routers and queries for accounts.


## February 13, 2023
We had more discussion on the api design — basically fleshing out the ideas and we decided to not go with the extra distinction of templates. We changed the api design and wireframe accordingly.


We then started working on the project set up. We as a group – ally sharing screen writing code – finished the project set-up page with the yaml file, including the pdAdmin setup.


## February 10, 2023
We had a talk with Riley and we felt like we needed to think about simplifying our projects. We had more discussion on the directions of our project.


## February 8, 2023
We started the api designs of mySwolePal. We created the endpoints and the corresponding details for each HTTP request we think we will need to use for our project.


## February 7, 2023
We continued working on the wireframes and fleshing out our visions for the app. Almost done with a somewhat complete version with the distinction between template and workouts.


## February 6, 2023
We brainstormed about the many ideas we want to make for our application. We settled on the workout app tentatively. After talking with the instructors, we started on the wireframes.
