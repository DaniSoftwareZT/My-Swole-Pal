## Wednesday, February 8, 2023
Our team worked on the api-design doc together as we though through the routes for each page and the user's journey.

Our team worked on the api-design and wireframes to restructure our project after meeting with one of the instructors to figure out the api endpoints. We found that the creation of workout templates would be too complicated to tackle over the time for the project completion.

## Monday, February 13, 2023
Removed the planner aspect from our API design and wireframes to restructure our project to make it so that users can simply filter exercises to add to a workout. Finished wireframes and api-design file.

I'm still sick and have has a fever since yesterday. Our team continued to work on our project and did part of the workouts endpoints.

## Tuesday, February 21, 2023
Today I coded for the team and I finished the workouts endpoint. We also did the exercises and searches endpoints to ensure we were pulling data from the third party api.

Our team worked on finishing the backend, Ally was the coder for the team today.

Today Edwin coded for the team and we worked on getting the frontend signup form to work but once it started working we decided to add in redux. Redux is a learning curve for the whole team but we're slowly putting it together.

## Friday, February 24, 2023
We struggled a lot with redux, we're not sure if we'll continue working with it. Adrian was the coder for the team.

## Monday, February 27, 2023
Today our team got the signup form to work with redux. We were trying to format things with modals but were having a lot of issues with it. Daniel was our typer for the day.

## Tuesday, February 28, 2023
I coded for the team today. We were able to finish the front end authentication, sing-up and login forms are working now. We started creating the exercise search page including exercise cards so users can search based on difficulty, muscle, and type.

## Wednesday, March 1, 2023
We were stuck on getting the exercise searches to work with redux but Candice helped us with bugs, Edwin coded for the team.

## Thursday, March 2, 2023
Ally coded for the team today. We were working on creating workouts and including exercises, we got stuck at the end of the day.

## Friday, March 3, 2023
Adrian coded for the team today. We were able to getting the view for the workouts working but only by creating them in the backend. We tried to get the add workout button to work on the front end but got stuck at the end of the day and by the time we asked for help Candice was no longer available so we decided to continue working on this on Monday.

## Monday, March 6,2023
Daniel coded for the team today. We worked on fixing bugs and the add exercise functionality to a workout.

## Tuesday, March 7, 2023
Edwin coded for the team in the morning to finish up the front end workout delete feature, we were able to get it done with the help of some SEIRS. In the afternoon we all took turns working through unit tests together.

## Wednesday, March 8, 2023
Today our team divided up the pages for styling. I worked on the workout view page to give it a dark theme, I moved around the buttons to the top so that the user could have easy access to add exercises to their workouts and delete the workout all together.

## Thursday, March 9, 2023
I drove for the team part of the day while we created our Readme file and details. I independently worked on the color scheme and logo for the project and the team liked it so we applied it to the styling we each did for our respective pages. In the afternoon Adrian coded for the team and we all worked on fine tuning the design and structure of the pages, we got rid of all the bugs and brainstormed ideas for the home page.

## Friday, March 10, 2023
We wrapped up the styling with some changes Edwin worked on and he was able to merge everything to the main branch without any conflicts. Edwin presented for the team and the presentation went great, we'll probably work on stretch goals and deployment next week.
